Financial fraud and bankruptcy are inextricably linked, as fraudulent acts frequently result in bankruptcy for the persons or businesses involved. Individuals or businesses may petition for bankruptcy protection in order to reorganize their obligations and achieve financial stability in the event of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy filings, on the other hand, can be used to conceal fraudulent acts or to avoid the repercussions of financial misconduct. Individuals who have committed fraud, for example, may seek to transfer assets to a third party or file for bankruptcy in order to avoid paying restitution to their victims. As a result, bankruptcy courts and trustees play an important role in identifying and combating financial fraud, and may launch investigations into debtors' actions to find fraudulent activity. Furthermore, bankruptcy rules and regulations are continually developing in reaction to emerging kinds of financial fraud, in order to better safeguard creditors' interests and prevent the bankruptcy system from being abused.
